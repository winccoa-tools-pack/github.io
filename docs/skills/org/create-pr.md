# Create Pull Request

Guide for creating well-structured Pull Requests.

## Before You Start

- Issue is approved and assigned
- Branch follows naming convention (see [git-flow](git-flow.md))
- All commits follow [conventional commits](conventional-commits.md)
- Tests pass locally

## PR Title

Use the same format as commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Examples:
```
feat(parser): add support for nested configs
fix(ui): resolve panel flickering on resize
docs: update installation guide
```

## Target Branch

| Your branch | PR target | Merge strategy |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| `feature/*` | `develop` | Squash |
| `bugfix/*` | `develop` | Squash |
| `fork:develop` / `fork:feature/*` / `fork:bugfix/*` | `develop` | Squash |
| `release/v*` | `main` | Merge commit *(created by action)* |
| `hotfix/v*` | `main` | Merge commit *(created by action)* |
| Upmerge | `develop` | Merge commit *(created by action)* |

## PR Description

Each repository has two PR templates — GitHub will prompt you to choose:

- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/feature-bugfix.md` — for feature and bugfix PRs
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release.md` — for release and hotfix PRs (auto-selected by the action)

Fill out the chosen template completely before requesting review.
